I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), working under the supervision of my advisor [William G.J. Halfond](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~halfond/). I have a passion for software engineering, especially when it comes to making software more accessible for everyone. As someone who relies on Assistive Technology, I've noticed that there's still plenty of room for improvement in the software we use today, especially for people with disabilities. My research focuses on enhancing the quality assurance processes for web applications and making sure that software user interfaces are accessible to all. I'm excited about the work I'm doing and the positive changes we can bring! ðŸ˜Š
