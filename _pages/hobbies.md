In addition to my research, I enjoy taking pictures and videos, watching movies, and playing computer games. 

I cherish outings with my Bro, especially when we go to the movies and treat ourselves to "freshly fried" french fries from drive-thrus. I absolutely adore Mexican food, and I love exploring different taco trucks around Los Angeles. One of my favorite activities is attending county fairs to people-watch and sample various fried snacks.

When I’m chillin’ at home, I enjoy playing my favorite computer game, *Dota 2*, with my online friends. Although I am not good at the game, I appreciate being carried by friends. In my spare time, I like designing and refining adaptive switch controls that I can use to play *Dota 2*, hoping to improve my gameplay experience.

When I was younger, I had a hobby of drawing. I created a lot of cartoon-style artwork using colored pencils and won numerous competitions. After my injury, I discovered a new way to express myself through art by mouth-painting with fine-point markers and pastels.
