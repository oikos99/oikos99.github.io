I integrated accessibility into the CSCI 310 Software Engineering course by developing two original lectures that focus on the role of accessibility in software development. I also created an in-class activity module aimed at helping students achieve their learning objectives through hands-on accessibility testing and remediation. Additionally, I incorporated accessibility requirements into the studentsâ€™ course projects, allowing them to gain practical, real-world experience with accessibility concepts.
