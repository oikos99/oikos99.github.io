The keyboard is the most universally supported input method operable by people with disabilities. Yet, many popular websites lack keyboard accessible mechanism, which could cause failures that make the website unusable. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically detecting and localizing keyboard accessibility failures in web applications. Our extensive evaluation of our technique on real world web pages showed that our technique was able to detect keyboard failures in web applications with high precision and recall and was able to accurately identify the underlying elements in the web pages that led to the observed problems.
